# 🧙‍♂ Gatherer Sage: Training a LLM on Magic: The Gathering Data ✨
Welcome to **Gatherer Sage**, an open-source side project where a love for **Magic: The Gathering** meets the world of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. If you’re a fan of Magic and also intrigued by the power of AI, you’re in the right place! 😄

## ⚠️ Disclaimer: Work in Progress 🛠️

Gatherer Sage is still a **work in progress** and evolving every day! 😅 Expect bugs, incomplete features, and some messy code here and there. I'm actively working on improving the project, so if something looks a bit chaotic, don’t worry—it’s part of the process! More updates and refinements are on the way, and any feedback or contributions are super appreciated! 🙌


## 🎯 Why Gatherer Sage?
Magic has always been more than a game to me—it's a universe where creativity, strategy, and mathematics collide in a beautiful way. One day, while sleeving my favorite Selesnya deck 🌳☀️, I thought: "What if a machine could understand Magic?" Not just the cards, but the subtle dynamics between them, the synergies, and even the meta!

And so, Gatherer Sage came to life! Initially, the goal was to create an AI that could assist with rulings during casual games without a judge, helping to clarify tricky interactions. But as I delved deeper, I realized the potential for the model to do much more. Now, the aim is not only to support rulings but also to assist with drafting, deck analysis, and even understanding complex card synergies, helping players improve their gameplay or, at the very least, have some fun experimenting with AI! 🤖✨
